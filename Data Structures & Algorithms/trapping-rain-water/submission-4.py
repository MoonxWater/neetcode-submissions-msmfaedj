    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        '''
        the constraints say that min len of height is one, so return 0
        immediately since there is 0 capacity for elevation with 2 or less
        elements

        two pointers, l and r starting at 0 and 1
        another pointer boundary starting at end
        
        update l till l + 1 is smaller than l. this implies we have 
        found a downward slope so there is a chance that water can be 
        stored from here

        update boundary from right to left till height at boundary - 1 is 
        <= height at boundary which implies that there is a downward slope
        before boundary

        a loop wil go from l till l < boundary and r < boundary.
        since r and l will update within the loop at different speeds,
        assign the current value of l + 1 to r at start

        the plan is to move the pointer r till the height at r is 
        >= height at l. this would imply that we
        have found a container.

        while r is incrementing till we find a container, add each 
        invalid height to a rocks list so that we can subtract it from 
        the capacity later. we add this to a list and not sum it 
        immediately because we don't know what is the height of the
        container till me find both ends.

        the other end will be either when height at r is >= height
        at l or r has reached boundary

        in either case calculate: 
            min(height[l], height[r]) -> min_height
            for each rock in rocks list:
                if rock <= min_height
                    rocks += rock
                else if rock > min_height this implies that
                we don't need that extra height exceeding 
                min_height
                    rocks += min_height

        finally update capacity:
            capacity += (min_height * (r - l - 1)) - rocks
            this -1 is important because the width of each
            element is one.
        
        we then update l to the current position of r and 
        continue

        finally return capacity
        '''

        if len(height) <= 2: return 0

        l = 0
        capacity = 0
        r = 1
        boundary = len(height) - 1

        while height[l] <= height[l + 1]:
            l += 1
        
        while height[boundary] <= height[boundary - 1]:
            boundary -= 1

        while l < boundary and r < boundary:        
            r = l + 1
            rocks_list = []
            rocks = 0

            while r < boundary and height[r] < height[l]:
                rocks_list.append(height[r])
                r += 1
            
            min_height = min(height[l], height[r])

            for i, rock in enumerate(rocks_list):
                if rock >= min_height:
                    rocks += min_height
                else:
                    rocks += rock

            capacity += (min_height * (r - l - 1)) - rocks
